# responsiver
A short code to make your website responsive.

# Usage:

<p>Put the /index.php into your root directory and DO NOT rename it.<br/>
Create two other document in the root directory (for example: /index_desktop.php for desktop and<br/>/index_mobile.php for mobile content) or name it whatever you want.<br/>
The best example for this is one of my <a href="https://github.com/Szeccsa/telenor.hu" target="_blank">projects</a> where the website is too old, not using media queries and using two separate documents to look cool on both mobile and desktop.
